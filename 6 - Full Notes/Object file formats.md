[[03 Object Files]]

Some famous file formats that are used by various operation systems are - 
- ELF by linux and unix like systems
- Mach-O used in OS-X
- PE used in Windows.
But these all stem from something called as the `a.out` file format. This stands for assembler output, and was used in earlier versions of UNIX. Later, it was replaced my `COFF`  - Common Object File Format. It is the basis of the ELF file format, and the Portable Extension (PE) format for windows.
