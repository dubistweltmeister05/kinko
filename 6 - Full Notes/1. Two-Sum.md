Right, the way I see it is that we gotta get that array sorted out first, in ascending order. 

Then, we need to see if the middle element of the sorted array is bigger than the target. 
	- If it is, then we set the low pointer on the first index, and the high pointer on the middle element's index. 
	- If it is lesser, then we set the lower pointer to the middle element's index and then the higher pointer goes on the last element of the arrray. 

Then, we iterate again, considering the sub array.

# YEAH NOOO

## **Steps**

1. **Outer Loop**:
    
    - Iterate through the array using the outer loop. This loop represents the first index of the result array.
        
    - For each element at index `i`, initialize the inner loop.
        
2. **Inner Loop**:
    
    - Iterate through the array starting from `i + 1` (the next element after the current outer loop index). This loop represents the second index of the result array.
        
    - For each element at index `j`, check if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` equals the target.
        
3. **Check for Target Sum**:
    
    - If `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`, return the indices `[i, j]` as the result.
        
4. **No Solution Case**:
    
    - If no such pair is found after completing the loops, return an indication that no solution exists (e.g., `[-1, -1]` or `NULL`).

## **Time Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n2)O(n2), where nn is the size of the array. This is because for each element in the outer loop, the inner loop iterates through the remaining elements.

## **Space Complexity**

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)O(1), as no additional data structures are used.

## **Code Example (C)**

`int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize) {`
    `// Allocate memory for the result array`
    `int* result = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));`
    `if (result == NULL) {`
        `*returnSize = 0; // Indicate no solution`
        `return NULL;`
    `}`

    `// Initialize result array`
    `result[0] = -1;`
    `result[1] = -1;`

    `// Outer loop: first index`
    `for (int i = 0; i < numsSize - 1; i++) {`
        `// Inner loop: second index`
        `for (int j = i + 1; j < numsSize; j++) {`
            `// Check if the sum equals the target`
            `if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {`
                `result[0] = i;`
                `result[1] = j;`
                `*returnSize = 2; // Set the size of the returned array`
                `return result; // Return the indices`
            `}`
        `}`
    `}`

    `// No solution found`
    `*returnSize = 0;`
    `free(result); // Free the allocated memory`
    `return NULL;`
`}`

---

## **Key Points**

- The brute force approach is simple and easy to implement but has a higher time complexity.
    
- It does not require additional space, making it memory-efficient.
    
- Suitable for small input sizes due to its O(n2)O(n2) time complexity.

# Another method
## Use Hash Maps

We will use the hash map to solve two sum, and here's how we do it. 
- First, the numbers will be the keys and the indices will be the values in the hash map
- for each number, we'll calculate the complement of the number, that is `target-number`
- if the complement exists in the map, we've found the pain, and we'll return the number and the complement's index.
- if not found, store the number in the hash map.
