## 📄 Problem Description
<!-- Briefly describe the problem statement here -->
The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return _the **Hamming distance** between them_.
## 🧠 Algorithm Used
<!-- Describe the algorithm you used to solve the problem -->
This is a classic bitwise operation question that I have seen across Leetcode. 

We just have to count the number of bit positions between the two numbers where the bits are of different values.

The trick here is to remember XOR operation and its properties. The XOR of similar tings is 0 and of different tings is 1.

## 🛠️ Approach
<!-- Explain your approach step-by-step -->

1. XOR the two numbers x and y and store the value into a variable `res` .
2. Starting from the LSB of `res` , check if the bit is = 1. If it is , then increment a `count` variable. 
3. Shift the variable `res` by 1.
4. Repeat till res=0.

## 💻 Accepted Code
```
int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {

    int res = x ^ y;

    int count = 0;

    while (res != 0) {

        if ((res & 0x1) == 1) {

            count++;

        }

        res = res >> 1;

    }

    return count;

}
```
