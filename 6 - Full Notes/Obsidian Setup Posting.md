[[Productivity Posting]]

The main issue I faced all throughout last year was a clouded mind. The lack of clarity and a disillusioned vision of the path ahead plagued me all throughout 2024. 

Now, what would a man be worth if he refused to mend his mistakes? So here I am, starting 2025 off with an attempt to not only gain, but also to retain clarity and focus my energy on what lies ahead this year!

Presenting my personal setup on obsidian. This app has been a blessing in disguise for me. Never before was productivity made to effective, especially as I juggle an internship, academics and my final-year project! 

The folder structure is as follows - 
1 - Rough notes. These are the un-structured notes for what I want to remember, lists, ideas, reminders, trackers, etc.

2 - Sources. That's where I store all the important things I come across, YT videos, Tweets, Research Paper DOIs, etc.

3 - Tags. These are organizers for my notes. Essentially, empty notes that hold TOPICS for which I am writing notes about. 

4 - Indexes. These are groups of tags. I refer to these as Chapters of Knowledge.

5 - Templates. These hold the standard templates that I have made for few types of notes. Code documentation, Header and footer for my blog, etc. 

6 - Full Notes. This is the folder that holds all the notes that I make, EVER!

In a year, I'm sure that the amount of knowledge that I would have collected on this vault would be unparalleled. Some call it manifestation, I simply call it a declaration! 

So, what's your note-taking strategy? How do you keep a track of interesting things that you come across? Let's discuss!!
