I am at a weird point at work man. I look around me and I see Gods, who are unfathomably good at what they do. No matter the challenge, the task, the bug or the error - they seem to always get it done. 

I interact with them, and they are the most humble and helping seniors I have ever seen - wiling to help out when demanded and push me when needed. 

I look at them and naturally, I aspire to be just as good one day, if not better. 

And then I look at myself. I get happy and hyped when I raise a simple PR man. Fix support for an audio codec, and I am on the moon! Sure, it was barely 20 lines of code, but the effort to get those 20 lines was huge, at least, for me. In my silly little mind, I gotta get on the level of those who I see around me, and I cannot seem to understand that it'll take YEARS for me to do that. 

I want it. NOW. 

Sure it's been my 6th week here, but I cannot let that bother me at all. 

But one thing I have learned the hard way so far - patience is a virtue that pays off exponentially. Stick with it. That's the key, sticking to what I do the best. 

Keep doing it, keep learning, keep implementing, keep building, keep failing, keep getting up and trying a different fucking method to debug the issue that I have been banging my head over since the last week, keep breaking the local setup, keep fixing the mistakes that you left yesterday, saying "isko kal dekha jayega". 

6 weeks over here, and I can feel mydself being a better engineer. Come 6 months, and I cannot even begin to Imagine the highs that are to be achieved.

I lose sleep at night when I know I ain't good enough. Bur what good is a rocket that burns out before it lands?!
