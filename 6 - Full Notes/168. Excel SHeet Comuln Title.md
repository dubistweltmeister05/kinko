## 📄 Problem Description
<!-- Briefly describe the problem statement here -->
Given an integer `columnNumber`, return _its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet_.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
## 🧠 Algorithm Used
<!-- Describe the algorithm you used to solve the problem -->
The algorithm converts a given column number into an Excel-style column title by repeatedly extracting characters from the right. It treats the column number as **a base-26 system** (like how numbers work in decimal or binary) but adjusted so that 'A' corresponds to **1** instead of **0**. 
In each step, it **decrements** the column number by 1 to shift the range (`A = 0`, `B = 1`, ..., `Z = 25`), extracts the last character using modulo (`% 26`), and then moves left by dividing the number by 26. This process continues until the number becomes **zero**. 
The extracted characters are stored in a buffer from **right to left**, and the final result is returned as a string. 
The algorithm runs in **O(log n) time** since the number is repeatedly divided by 26, and it uses **O(1) space** if a fixed-size buffer is used.
## 🛠️ Approach
<!-- Explain your approach step-by-step -->

1.  **Uses a fixed static buffer (`title[8]`)** to store the result.
2.  **Processes the number in reverse**, filling the array from the end (`i = 6` down to `0`).
3. **Adjusts `columnNumber--`** to make it 0-based (`A = 0`, ..., `Z = 25`).
4. **Extracts characters using modulo (`% 26`)** and assigns them as ASCII uppercase letters.
5.  **Moves left (`i--`), divides by 26 (`columnNumber /= 26`)**, and continues until `columnNumber == 0`.
6. **Returns the pointer to the result** (`&title[i+1]`).

## 💻 Accepted Code
```
char* convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {
    static char title[8]={};
    title[7]='\0';

    int i=6;

    while(columnNumber!=0 &&i>=0){
        columnNumber--;
        title[i]=(columnNumber%26)+'A';
        columnNumber/=26;
        i--;
    }
    return &title[i+1];
}
```
