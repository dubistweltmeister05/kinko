This is a note to all my fellow 2025 batch mates. I know that we all have put on a brave face as we start living our lives the way that we have always wanted to, but deep down, we are all just scared.

Lemme talk to you for a second, as I say the quite part out loud. This isn't a technical post, and I know I have been lagging with some real-engineering things on my TL. Here is the thing, self-doubt and despair have been doing to my psyche what Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma did to the rest of the IPL in the Last season - straight destruction of any and all.

As the days go by and as the joining day comes near, a silent realization hits us all. The slow dread creeps upon all our minds, that the time that we prayed for is finally here. The day when we are no longer a student anymore, and a working, professional adult in the cold, real world is finally here. 

We prayed for this phase of our life to arrive ass soon as possible. 
We cried for the freedom that it offered. 
We yearned for the independence that it promised. 

But now that the day draws closer and close with each passing moment - 
We dread the responsibilities that it brings. 
We dread the accountability that it imposes. 
We dread the uncertainty that it delivers. 

Let me speak for myself. I am in a new city, working a job that I don't know much about, at a company who's pace is faster than Usain-fucking-Bolt in his prime. Lads, I am uncertain of myself. Will I be able to perform? Will I be able to make good of my potential? Will I be able to manage my life with the money that I will be earning? Will all that I have dreamed about, ever come to fruition? 

The truth is, I don't fucking know.

What I do know, is that like I have so far in the last 21 years of my life, I will not stop till I give my all. If that works out, I succeed. It it doesn't, at least I won't blame myself for not trying hard enough. 

I am at a point in my life, where I will stretch myself to the mortal limit to chase the dreams that I have seen. The rest, I shall submit to the Lord above. 4 years of tier-69 college engineering, and I turn out to be as good as I am due to my own effort? That was enough for me to fully believe in God, y'all.

I start my work as a Linux Kernel Developer tomorrow. And all I know, is that there are no lengths that I will hesitate from stretching myself to in order to be the best that my org has ever seen or will ever see. There is a certain fire that burns within me, that no level of self doubt will be able to deter, and that alone is the reason why I am in this position in the first place.

And it's not just about being amazing at work. I have to be a better friend, a better Senior to the idiots from my college (I love them to death), better at what sport I pick, better at managing my money, better at being an Indian, better at being a Hindu, and finally, better at being a human. That was a promise I made to my 18 year old self, and regardless of what @Shark says, not all promises that I make are broken!

To all my fellow batch mates of 2025. If you relate to anything that I have said, just know that if I can make it - then so can you, lads. Come on now. Life just got a lot more real than it ever has been.

All gloves are off now. 

Let's get down and dirty.
