## 📄 Problem Description
<!-- Briefly describe the problem statement here -->
You are given an array of **unique** integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is the salary of the `ith` employee.

Return _the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.
## 🧠 Algorithm Used
<!-- Describe the algorithm you used to solve the problem -->
Simple enough to be honest, you just need to sort the array out, then get the average of everything that is in there apart from the first and the last one. 
## 🛠️ Approach
<!-- Explain your approach step-by-step -->

## 💻 Accepted Code
```
double average(int* salary, int salarySize) {
    for (int i = 0; i < salarySize; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < salarySize; j++) {
            if (salary[i] > salary[j]) {
                int temp = 0;
                temp = salary[i];
                salary[i] = salary[j];
                salary[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < salarySize - 1; i++) {
        sum += salary[i];
    }

    return sum/(salarySize-2);
}
