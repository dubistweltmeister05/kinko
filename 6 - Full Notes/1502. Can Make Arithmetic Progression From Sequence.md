## 📄 Problem Description
<!-- Briefly describe the problem statement here -->
A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` _if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return_ `false`.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
<!-- Describe the algorithm you used to solve the problem -->
Simple. An AP is something that has a constant difference between it's consecutive terms. 
So, sort the array, and check for the difference between all the consecutive elements. 

If the difference is the same, GG. If it's not, then we return `false`
## 🛠️ Approach
<!-- Explain your approach step-by-step -->

1. Sort, you know how. (Double nested loop ting)
2. get the difference between the first and the second terms of the sorted array
3. loop through the array again to see if there is any point where the consecutive terms have a difference between them that is NOT equal to the difference that we calculated earlier. 

## 💻 Accepted Code

```
#include <math.h>
bool canMakeArithmeticProgression(int* arr, int arrSize) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arrSize; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < arrSize; j++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[j])
                arr[i] ^= arr[j] ^= arr[i] ^= arr[j];
        }
    }

    int diff = abs(arr[1] - arr[0]);
    for (int k = arrSize-1; k > 1; k--) {
        if (abs(arr[k] - arr[k - 1]) != diff) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
