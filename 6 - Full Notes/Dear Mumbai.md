I swear I hate to write this, for the second time, I have to leave your humbling presence, my dear city. It is only right that I narrate the story of my life with you so far.

Dear Mumbai, you are the place where my father came in 1999, as a young adult to make his destiny. You are the city where my mother came in 2001 after her marriage to my father, and where I was born in 2003. 

Dear Mumbai, your temples and it's fancy-dress competitions are the very place where a child, aged 5, dressed up as Lokmanya Tilak and delivered a 3 minute speech, all memorized in front of a crowd of 700+ people. All by himself. That very child then went on to take part in the city level competitions like Nrityanjali, and DOMINATED in every category that he touched. That very child stood third in the city in a Gita recitation competition by the Chinmaya mission, and as he grew older, he kept on piling accolades.The language was never a barrier you see. That child won at the Rotary Club's debates as well as the Arya Samaj's elocution competition. 

Dear Mumbai, you housed the school of DAV, Nerul; where I spent 13 years of my life. From kindergarten to my 10th standard, the bastion of Indian school education took good care of me. It was here that I honed my love for sciences and electronics, and apart from the nerdy stuff, it was here that I learnt how to love music. From signing up for the choir as a wee little kid to leading the instruments with my guitar in my last year there, from banging on the drums every morning for the march drill, to bunking classes just to get an extra jamming session, I am damn sure I'll be re-playing my memories there for the rest of my life.

Dear Mumbai, you are the city that gave me friends who have been with me for 19 out of my soon-to-be 22 years of my life. You taught me how to cherish a bond between humans, even when we lead a life which has it's pace faster than a ball bowled by prime Dale Steyn.

Dear Mumbai, you taught me to find joy in sports, be it Club cricket at Shivaji Park, Getting my Black belt and going a step beyond that in karate, or playing football everyday for 4 continuous years, till the day I left. 

Dear Mumbai, you showed me that life is not all roses and sunshine. You not only taught me, but showed me to the dark realities of life, of poverty, of drugs, of debt, of crime, of addictions, of death and so much more. You taught me what my parents wished I never knew the existence of. You never cared that I was 10 when my family lose everything. Or that I was 11 when the money collectors came around. Or that I was 12 when I had to wipe them tears off of my parents face when all hope was lost. 

Dear Mumbai, I believe you did so because somewhere along my life, you and God had a conversation, where he assured you that no matter what challenge you threw at me, I will come out of it a better man. You forced a mere child to become a man wayy before his time, and now, at 21, I can only thank you.

I went away the last time when I was 18. And I swore that I'd never return till I became capable of re-claiming everything that we lost in this city. Now, I go away again, to make good on that capability. 

I will return to your arms my, dear Mumbai. And the next time I do, I will not fucking leave. You set me on the path that I took to get here. And the last time I checked, I didn't come this far, to come just this far.

Dear Mumbai, I now go away to an old friend of yours. I hope you remember Surat, Gujarat. I'll make sure to tell her that you say hi! And like the prodigal son of yours that I am, I will not let your name down.

Dear Mumbai, I cannot thank you enough. Rest assured, I will not let you down.
