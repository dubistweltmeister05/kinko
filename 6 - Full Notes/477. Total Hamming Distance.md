## 📄 Problem Description
<!-- Briefly describe the problem statement here -->
The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the sum of **Hamming distances** between all the pairs of the integers in_ `nums`.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
<!-- Describe the algorithm you used to solve the problem -->
### **I tried the nested loop approach.**
For a pair, to find the hamming distance is quite easy. You simply - 
	- XOR the numbers
	- Put it in a variable
	- count the number of 1s in the variable.

Then, I has 2 loops, inner and outer where I called the hamming distance function for each pair of numbers.
IT WORKED.
IT WAS ALSO A BIT SHITE TO BE HONEST, O(n^2) [eww]. 

The OPTIMIZED algo is as follows. 
- for each position, calculate how many numbers have a 1.
- for each bit position, the contribution to the total hamming distance is the product of the number of 1s and the number of 0s.

## 🛠️ Approach
<!-- Explain your approach step-by-step -->

1. Loop through each bit position
2. Count the number of 1s at the current bit position
3. Calculate the contribution to the total Hamming distance

## 💻 Accepted Code

```

int totalHammingDistance(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int totalHD = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        int bitCount = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < numsSize; j++) {
            bitCount += (nums[j] >> i) & 1;
        }
        totalHD += bitCount * (numsSize - bitCount);
    }
    return totalHD;
}

```
