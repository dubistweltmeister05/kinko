## 📄 Problem Description
<!-- Briefly describe the problem statement here -->
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays `$5`.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` is the bill the `ith` customer pays, return `true` _if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or_ `false` _otherwise_.
## 🧠 Algorithm Used
<!-- Describe the algorithm you used to solve the problem -->
I'll be honest. 
DeepSeekEd it.

- **Initialize Counters**
    
    - Maintain two counters:
        - `five`: Number of $5 bills available.
        - `ten`: Number of $10 bills available.
    - We do not need to track `$20` bills because we only give change with `$5` and `$10`.
- **Iterate Through the `bills` Array:**
    
    - For each customer, check the bill they pay with:
        
    - **Case 1: `$5` bill**
        
        - No change is needed, simply increase `five`.
    - **Case 2: `$10` bill**
        
        - The customer needs `$5` as change.
        - If `five > 0`, give the change (`five--`) and collect the `$10` (`ten++`).
        - If `five == 0`, return `false` (insufficient change).
    - **Case 3: `$20` bill**
        
        - The customer needs `$15` as change.
        - **Priority 1**: If `ten > 0` and `five > 0`, give `$10 + $5` as change (`ten--, five--`).
        - **Priority 2**: If `ten == 0`, check if we have `three $5` bills (`five >= 3`), and give `$5 + $5 + $5` (`five -= 3`).
        - If neither condition is met, return `false` (insufficient change).
- **If we process all customers successfully, return `true`.**

## 💻 Accepted Code

# 📊 Complexity Analysis
### **Time Complexity:**

- O(n) , since we iterate through the list once.

### **Space Complexity:**

- O(1) , since we use only two integer variables (`five` and `ten`).
