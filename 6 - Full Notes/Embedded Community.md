In India, embedded systems and low level programming is quite niche to say the very least.
95% of the Electronics and CS/IT students will spend the rest of their lives never caring about what this domain means and actually does. The irony is that this is the exact thing that powers the entire computing world, and a fundamental understanding of this is of paramount importance imo.

We often lament that there isn't a tribe of embedded developers where we can learn from. I personally believe that it is a very lonely domain, where it's quite literally you, your processor of choice, and your IDE/Terminal (if you are a badass like that) against the entire world. And if you think ChatGPT or Cursor is going to save your ass, well, even Gordon Ramsey would be proud at just how well cooked you truly will be!

Now, it doesn't have to be this way, and there is this man @PiyushItankar - who runs a one-stop solution for embedded education through the pyjamabrah platform (https://pyjamabrah.com/products/embedded-engineering/#tech-syncs), and an amazing discord channel (https://discord.gg/HWqcHkvN), that I highly recommend those who are interested to know about embedded systems and software to join and take a look if y'all enjoy the vibe.

You lot know that I don't go around making BS recommendations, and having been in the server myself for more than a year now, I can personally vouch for the quality of the people and the discussions there. 

As for the learning platform, trust me when I say this - I PRAYED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE MAN! Piyush is an amazing teacher, and I really recommend his work. 

All in all, do take a look y'all!
