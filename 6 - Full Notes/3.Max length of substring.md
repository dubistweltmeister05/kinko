# `lengthOfLongestSubstring` Function Documentation

## Description

The `lengthOfLongestSubstring` function calculates the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. It uses the **Sliding Window** technique to efficiently solve the problem.

---

## Function Signature

`int lengthOfLongestSubstring(char* s);`

---

## Parameters

- **`s`**: A pointer to a null-terminated string (character array) for which the length of the longest substring without repeating characters is to be calculated.
    

---

## Return Value

- Returns an integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
## Algorithm

The function uses the **Sliding Window** technique with the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window (substring).
        
    - Use an array `lastIndex` to store the last occurrence index of each character in the string.
        
    - Initialize `maxLen` to store the maximum length of the substring found so far.
        
2. **Sliding Window**:
    
    - Iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.
        
    - If the current character has been seen before and is within the current window, move the `left` pointer to the right of the last occurrence of the current character.
        
    - Update the last occurrence index of the current character.
        
    - Update `maxLen` if the current window size (`right - left + 1`) is greater than `maxLen`.
        
3. **Return**:
    
    - Return `maxLen`, which is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
